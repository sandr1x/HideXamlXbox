HideXamlXbox is a simple executable that hides the annoying "DesktopWindowXamlSource" window after launching the Xbox App on Windows.

⚠️ Just a few hours after I posted this solution, MS released an Xbox app update (2507.1001.9.0) with a fix. You should update the Xbox app, but my method works too.

**Xbox-HX** - launches Xbox App and hides DesktopWindowXamlSource.

**HideXamlXbox** - only hides DesktopWindowXamlSource. It should be launched after the Xbox App is launched. Use this option if Xbox-HX is not working for some reason.

If you want to create a shortcut, the path to the Xbox App icon will be something like this: %ProgramFiles%\WindowsApps\Microsoft.GamingApp_2506.1001.20.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\XboxPcApp.exe
