HideXamlXbox is a simple executable that hides the annoying "DesktopWindowXamlSource" window after launching the Xbox App on Windows.

**Xbox-HX** - launches Xbox App and hides DesktopWindowXamlSource.

**HideXamlXbox** - only hides DesktopWindowXamlSource. It should be launched after the Xbox App is launched. Use this option if Xbox-HX is not working for some reason.
